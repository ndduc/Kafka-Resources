Topic replication factor
	- replication factor should be > 1 (usually between 2 and 3)
	- If one broker is down, another can serve the data
	
Concept of Leader for a partition
	- At anytime only one brokder can be a leader for a given parition
	- Producer can only send data to the broker that is leader of a partition
	- The other broker will replicate the data
	- Each Parittion has one in sync leader and multiple in sync replicas

Default procuder and consumer behavior with LEADERS
	- Kafka producer can only write to the leader broker for a partition
	- Kafka consumer by default will read from the leader broker for a partition
	
Kafka Cconsumer replica Fetching (v2.4+)
	- it is possible to config consumer to read from the closet replica
	- Improve latency and decrease network cost if using cloud
	
Product Acknowledgement (ACKs)
	- Procuder can choose to receive acknowledment of data write
		- acks = 0; produce wont wait for acknowledment (possible data loss)
		- acks = 1; producer wait for leader ack (limited data loss)
		- acks = all; leader + replicas acknowledment (no data loss)
		
Kafka Topic Durability
	- Topic with replication factor of 3 -> can withstand 2 broker loss
	- Common rule for replication factor
		- You can permanently lose up to N-1 broker and still recover your data
